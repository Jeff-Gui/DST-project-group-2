    "summary" : "Currently no pharmacogenomics-based criteria exist to guide clinicians in identifying individuals who are at risk of hearing loss from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This review summarizes findings from pharmacogenomic studies that report genetic polymorphisms associated with cisplatin-induced hearing loss and aims to (1) provide up-to-date information on new developments in the field, (2) provide recommendations for the use of pharmacogenetic testing in the prevention, assessment, and management of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and adults, and (3) identify knowledge gaps to direct and prioritize future research. These practice recommendations for pharmacogenetic testing in the context of cisplatin-induced hearing loss reflect a review and evaluation of recent literature, and are designed to assist clinicians in providing optimal clinical care for patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy.",

Around 10% of the population carry one of these TPMT risk variants, which account for approximately 25% of patients with ototoxicity. Thus, the TPMT risk variants do not account for all cases of cisplatin ototoxicity. However, the high positive predictive value (92%) of the TPMT variants indicates that a vast majority of patients who carry these variants develop hearing loss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Currently, the impact of the genetic variants recommended for testing in children is unknown in adult patients. At this point, genetic testing to identify patients at risk for cisplatin-induced hearing loss is NOT recommended in adult patients <strong><em>(level C – optional recommendation)</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Testing for variants in COMT, ABCC3, CTR1, GSTs, LRP2, DNA repair genes and genes associated with deafness is currently not recommended for clinical use <strong><em>(level C – optional recommendation)</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Management options for patients carrying nonfunctional TPMT variants</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Physicians are encouraged to consider the use of otoprotectants (i.e. amifostine, sodium thiosulfate) if the patient’s tumour type is one for which otoprotectants may be effective to prevent cisplatin-induced ototoxicity without adversely affecting antitumour activity <strong><em>(level C - optional recommendation)</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternative treatments may be prescribed when they have demonstrated equal efficacy, manageable and acceptable toxicity, less ototoxicity, and are considered options within the current standards of care <strong><em>(level C - optional recommendation)</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where appropriate, physicians are encouraged to increase monitoring in high-risk patients <strong><em>(level C - optional recommendation)</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>High risk patients should be encouraged to receive more frequent follow-up audiometric hearing tests after treatment has ended <strong><em>(level C – optional recommendation)</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See full guideline [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/26960170\">26960170</a>] for further details and grading scheme.</p>\n",
